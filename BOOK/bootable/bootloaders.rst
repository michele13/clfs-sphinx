6.4. Bootloaders
================

There are many different bootloaders. Creating detailed instructions on how to use even the more popular ones is difficult as each architecture and 
board often has different levels of support or configuration options within each bootloader. Often, development kits will ship with a bootloader 
already configured, if your board comes with a bootloader pre-configured, it's best to start using that and then venture on to building the bootloader 
yourself later.

A few of the popular bootloaders include: 

| **Barebox**
