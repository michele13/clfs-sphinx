7.1. Introduction
=================

This chapter details how to install and configure the CLFS-Bootscripts package. Most of these scripts will work without modification, but a few require
additional configuration files because they deal with hardware-dependent information.

System-V style init scripts are employed in this book because they are widely used. For additional options, a hint detailing the BSD style init setup 
is available at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/bsd-init.txt. 
Searching the LFS mailing lists for “depinit” will also offer additional choices.

If using an alternative style of init scripts, skip this chapter and move on to :doc:`Making the CLFS System Bootable<../bootable/chapter>`.
