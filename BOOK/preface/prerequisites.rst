iii. Prerequisites
==================

Building a CLFS system is not a simple task. It requires a certain level of existing knowledge of Unix system administration in order to resolve problems, and correctly execute the commands listed. In particular, as an absolute minimum, the reader should already have the ability to use the command line (shell) to copy or move files and directories, list directory and file contents, and change the current directory. It is also expected that the reader has a reasonable knowledge of using and installing Linux software. A basic knowledge of the architectures being used in the Cross LFS process and the host operating systems in use is also required.

Because the CLFS book assumes at least this basic level of skill, the various CLFS support forums are unlikely to be able to provide you with much assistance. Your questions regarding such basic knowledge will likely go unanswered, or you will be referred to the CLFS essential pre-reading list.

Before building a CLFS system, we recommend reading the following HOWTOs: 

* Software-Building-HOWTO http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html
  
  This is a comprehensive guide to building and installing “generic” Unix software distributions under Linux.

* The Essential Pre-Reading Hint http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/essential_prereading.txt

  This is a hint written specifically for users new to Linux. It includes a list of links to excellent sources of information on a wide range of topics. Anyone attempting to install CLFS should have an understanding of many of the topics in this hint.
